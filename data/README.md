    * This file locally contains a directory called `data/csv` which contains CSV files imported from the above link and also an `nba.sqlite` file for the relational database
    
    * The directory and database is ignored in the `.gitignore` because of its size
    
    * Instead, `data/Bel-db` contains a smaller subset of this database and includes the csvs in addition to a `data/Bel-db/NBA.sqlite` file; this is the database used in the portal for the games data.
